{"name":"Prospective bio-marker validation with survival data","tagline":"R packages","body":"\r\nA suite of R packages pertaining to risk prediction with time-to-event data that I have developed in collaboration with Yingye Zheng. The packages are:\r\n\r\n- **survAccuracyMeasures**:  provides functions to estimate the AUC, TPR(c), FPR(c), PPV(c), and NPV(c) for for a specific timepoint and marker cutoff value c. Standard errors and confidence intervals are also computed. Either analytic or bootstrap standard errors can be computed.\r\n\r\n- **survCompetingRisk**: aims to help to evaluate the prognostic accuracy of a marker with multiple competing risk events. Functions to calculate the AUC, ROC, PPV, and NPV are provided. A discrete covariate Z, if available, can be included. \r\n\r\n- **survNRI** : Calculate NRI statistic for survival data using five different estimators. \r\n    \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
