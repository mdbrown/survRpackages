This folder contains R packages pertaining to risk prediction for time-to-event data. The packages are:

- survAccuracyMeasures:  provides functions to estimate the AUC, TPR(c), FPR(c), PPV(c), and NPV(c) for for a specific timepoint and marker cutoff value c. Standard errors and confidence intervals are also computed. Either analytic or bootstrap standard errors can be computed.

- survCompetingRisk: aims to help to evaluate the prognostic accuracy of a marker with multiple competing risk events. Functions to calculate the AUC, ROC, PPV, and NPV are provided. A discrete covariate Z, if available, can be included. 

- survNRI : Calculate NRI statistic for survival data using five different estimators. 
    
Both .zip (for windows) and .tar.gz (for Unix) versions of the packages are available. Any questions should be directed to marshall brown (mdbrown@fhcrc.org).
