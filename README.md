survRpackages
=============

This folder contains R packages regarding risk prediction with survival data that I have developed in collaboration with Yingye Zheng. The packages are:

- **survAccuracyMeasures**:  provides functions to estimate the AUC, TPR(c), FPR(c), PPV(c), and NPV(c) for for a specific timepoint and marker cutoff value c. Standard errors and confidence intervals are also computed. Either analytic or bootstrap standard errors can be computed.

- **survCompetingRisk**: aims to help to evaluate the prognostic accuracy of a marker with multiple competing risk events. Functions to calculate the AUC, ROC, PPV, and NPV are provided. A discrete covariate Z, if available, can be included. 

- **survNRI** : Calculate NRI statistic for survival data using five different estimators.
